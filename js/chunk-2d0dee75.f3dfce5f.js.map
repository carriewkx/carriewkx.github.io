In 2019, when Youzan got criticized by the public for implementing a 996 working schedule, the government announced that they would step in and investigate. Early 2021, Li Guohuai, one of the members of the national committee, has pointed out that after 2 years since the beginning of the investigation, 996 did not get alleviated but has gotten worse[4]. Li proposed to have more strict enforcement on 996 culture. Would this be another “much said and little done” by the government? Very possible, as the formation of such a brutal working schedule did not happen overnight, it is hard to change it over a short period of time.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The government should work on both the corporation side and the employee side.

It is because of such a group of 996, our country has gained worldwide attention in the past 40 years … I do not defend 996, I pay tribute to the strugglers.

Because this has always been a virtue in Chinese culture. Such spirit reached its peak during the Great Leap Forward (1958 - 1962)[9] when Mao wanted to surpass western countries in a short period of time and encouraged over-production and surplus which did not actually exist. Chinese people believed that if they worked hard enough, and struggled to be strong, nothing was impossible. If they could produce more steel than the west, China could beat them in industrialization. This of course has been proved to be a wrong-headed policy that caused deaths and starvation. The concept of non-stop hard-working is still influencing generations of Chinese. Business owners still believe that the harder you work, the more successful you would get, which is not true and I will discuss more later.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Additionally, Chinese society stereotypes programmers. Many think younger programmers are more valuable than the older ones as they are more energetic and could adapt to new technology faster. Jiang Fan, CEO of Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall businesses once required that all P8 level (equivalent to senior experts) employees should be below 35 years old[11]. He believes that programmers achieve full potential before that age. This becomes an indirect message telling people who are above 35 years old that they are useless. The only metrics he uses to value an employee becomes (a). the physical ability of the employee to keep up with the intense working hour demand and (b). ability to adapt to new information. Other metrics such as experience, discretion, insight, well-being, and leadership are undervalued. This also shows that he only cares about the company being successful and employee’s career development is not his business. In another way, he dehumanizes employees to only labour resources. The success of businesses does not mean the success of workers. Alibaba is indeed a successful company but that was built based on the exploitation of their employees’ health and energy.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The stereotype does not only exist within the tech industry but also in the general public who are heavily influenced by the news mentioned above. When I applied for university, I consulted a couple of my parents’ friends on what major I should choose, none of them suggested computer programming. There were mainly two reasons they gave: (1). Women are not suitable to be a programmer because women have to take long parental leave and it is hard to catch up on new technology. Women also do not have the physical capability of men to do intense programming work. (2). When programmers get old, you will not be able to compete with younger people and you will fall behind and eventually get kicked out of the game.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The yoke of such misconception made millions of Chinese programmers questioning themselves if it’s worth it to work their fingers to the bone for companies that do not even respect their basic rights.\")]),_c('h3',[_vm._v(\"Competitive Salary & Unidimensional View of Success\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Regardless of big tech giants’ intense working hours and competitive culture, they are still the dreamlands of millions of Chinese new grads every year as they provide extremely generous salaries and compensation.

Being successful is equivalent to making a lot of money. Other components such as personal development, contribution to society, happiness, etc. are slowly lost due to historical reasons.

Almost all citizens’ possessions were taken and collected. The memory of being impoverished had traumatized many. The survival mindset and the desire for material goods changed the mentality of the old generation.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"After China reopened, young adults grew up in an affluent society which made them more open-minded and rebellious.

Nowadays, they are no longer guaranteed for young people. When China reopened 40 years ago, the majority of Chinese had similar starting points and the market was fairly vacant.

In 2016, the number rose to 7.6 million[15]. The job market becomes more competitive with the surplus of grads. Another example is competing for government positions. Government jobs in China are known as the “Iron Rice Bowl” as they provide a stable income and working schedule. 30 years ago, government jobs were assigned to college grads, and later on, they became exam-based. In 2003, 87,000 people participated in the central government examination. In 2021, the number jumped to 1.5 million[16].
