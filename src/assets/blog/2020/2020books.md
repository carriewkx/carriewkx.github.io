# My 2020 Reading List 📚

Ever since university, I don't read much. Mainly because school was busy, and also being distracted by youtube and netflix (of course 😅)  Summer 2020 I was working from home due to Covid, I got more free time and even felt a bit bored at the end. So I started reading. Here are some interesting books I have read during 2020 summer lockdown.

  ### ⭐️⭐️⭐️

  This book is useful for people who has zero knowledge in personal finance management. The financial concepts are pretty basic, it emphasizes a lot on interest compounding which I have already knew about. 
  <!-- One thing I have learned from this book is finding a life coach/trainer. Having a trainer/coach would make life much easier. -->

  ### ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

  <!-- As an intern at RBC, I have heard about this book many times since it was based on story that happened in RBC. It is definately a great book for people who are interested in high frequency trading but don't know much about it.  -->
