# My 2020 Reading List 📚

Ever since university, I don't read much books. Mainly because school is always busy and there is always assignments due. Summer 2020 I was working from home because of Covid, I got more free time and even felt a bit bored at the end. So I started reading. Here are some interesting books I have read.

  This book is useful for people who has zero knowledge in personal finance management. The financial concepts are pretty basic, it emphasizes a lot on interest compounding which I have already learned about. One thing I have learned from this book is finding a life coach/trainer. Having a trainer/coach would make life much easier.

  ### ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

  As an intern at RBC, I have heard about this book many times since it was based on story that happened in RBC. It is definately a great book for people who are interested in high frequency trading but don't know much about it.
